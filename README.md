# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, its Jessica!
I'm a queer user experience researcher and designer in Victoria, Australia.

I love bringing a human connection to technology and designing playful solutions to innovative problems with a user-centered, detail-oriented approach. Itâ€™s always amazed me how thoughtful design has the power to change our world, and my goal throughout my work is change the status quo on how peopleâ€™s technology can work for them in an ethical way.

Collaboration between design and technology is the key to making magical user experiences. Iâ€™m very passionate about sustainability, diversity, healthcare UX, conversation design and connecting physical and virtual space.

- ðŸŽ“ Currently studying at Castlemaine Secondary College and plan to continue UX in my higher education.
- ðŸ”­ Right now Iâ€™m working on co-designing [Snowglobe](https://chatsnowglobe.co/).
